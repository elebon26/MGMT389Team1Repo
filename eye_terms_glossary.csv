term,definition
Aqueous humor,"The clear, watery fluid in the front part of the eye (between the cornea and the lens). The aqueous humor nourishes the lens and cornea (which have no blood supply) and maintains pressure inside the eye."
Anterior chamber,The fluid-filled space inside the eye between the cornea and the iris. This chamber holds the aqueous humor (fluid) and is part of the eye’s front segment.
Astigmatism,"A common vision condition caused by an irregular curvature of the cornea or lens. Instead of being perfectly round, the eye’s surface is shaped more like a football, which causes blurred or distorted vision at both far and near distances."
Cataract,"A clouding of the eye’s normally clear lens, which causes vision to become blurry or dim. Cataracts often develop with age and can make it feel like you are looking through a foggy or dirty window."
Choroid,The thin layer filled with blood vessels between the retina and the sclera (white of the eye). The choroid supplies the retina with oxygen and nutrients.
Ciliary body,"The ring of tissue toward the front of the eye that surrounds the lens. It contains the ciliary muscle and ciliary processes, which help the eye focus (by changing the lens shape) and produce the aqueous humor (the fluid in the eye), respectively."
Ciliary muscle,"The circular muscle within the ciliary body that adjusts the shape of the lens for focusing. When this muscle contracts or relaxes, it makes the lens thicker or thinner, allowing the eye to focus on objects at different distances."
Ciliary processes,The tiny structures on the ciliary body that produce aqueous humor (the eye’s internal fluid). These processes continually secrete fluid that fills the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye.
Cones,"The light-sensing cells in the retina that detect color and fine details. Cones work best in brighter light and allow us to see sharp, colorful images."
Conjunctiva,A transparent mucous membrane that covers the white part of the eye (sclera) and lines the inside of the eyelids. The conjunctiva helps lubricate and protect the eye.
Conjunctivitis,"Inflammation of the conjunctiva, often due to an infection or allergy. It’s commonly known as “pink eye” and causes redness, irritation, and sometimes discharge in the eye."
Cornea,"The clear, dome-shaped front surface of the eye. The cornea is like a window that lets light into the eye and begins focusing it. (It provides most of the eye’s focusing power.)"
Degeneration,"A gradual deterioration or breakdown of tissue, often due to aging or disease. In the eye, degeneration means part of the eye (for example, the retina or cornea) is losing its structure or function over time."
Diabetic retinopathy,"Damage to the retina caused by diabetes. High blood sugar levels can harm the small blood vessels in the retina, leading to bleeding, fluid leakage, and retinal changes that result in vision problems."
Drusen,"Small yellowish deposits that form under the retina, often in people over age 60. Drusen by themselves may not cause symptoms, but having many drusen is a risk factor for age-related macular degeneration (an eye disease affecting central vision)."
Endothelium,"A thin layer of cells that lines the inner surface of certain structures in the body. In the eye, the corneal endothelium is the single layer of cells on the inside of the cornea that pumps out excess fluid to keep the cornea clear."
Epithelium,"Layers of cells that cover surfaces or line cavities of the body. In the eye, for example, the cornea has an epithelium as its outermost layer – a thin layer of cells protecting the front of the eye."
Fluid buildup (edema),"An excessive accumulation of fluid in tissues or spaces, causing swelling. In the eye, fluid buildup can occur in or behind structures (like the retina), leading to increased pressure or swelling that impairs vision (for example, fluid buildup in the retina is called macular edema)."
Fovea,"A tiny pit in the center of the macula (the central area of the retina) where vision is sharpest. When you look directly at something, light is focused onto the fovea, giving you very clear detail for tasks like reading or recognizing faces."
Glaucoma,"A group of eye diseases usually caused by increased pressure inside the eye, leading to damage of the optic nerve. Glaucoma often has no early symptoms, but over time it can cause loss of peripheral (side) vision or blindness if not treated."
Hyaloid canal,"A narrow, clear channel that runs through the center of the vitreous humor (the gel in the eye) from the optic disc to the back of the lens. It is a remnant of fetal development and has no function in the adult eye."
Hyperopia (farsightedness),"A refractive condition where distant objects are seen more clearly than close ones. In hyperopia, it is hard to see up-close items (for example, reading text) clearly, while far-away objects may appear sharper."
Inflammation,"The body’s natural response to injury, irritation, or infection. In the eye, inflammation can cause redness, warmth, swelling, or pain in the affected area (for example, uveitis is inflammation inside the eye)."
Intraocular pressure (IOP),"The fluid pressure inside the eye. A healthy eye maintains a balance between fluid production and drainage to keep this pressure normal. If fluid builds up and the pressure rises too high, it can damage the optic nerve (as happens in glaucoma)."
Iris,"The colored part of the eye (usually brown, blue, etc.) that is actually a ring of muscle. The iris adjusts the size of the pupil (the central opening) to control how much light enters the eye."
Keratoconus,"A condition in which the cornea (the clear front of the eye) becomes progressively thinner and bulges outward into a cone shape. Keratoconus causes distorted vision because the cornea’s smooth, dome shape is altered. It often begins in the teen or young adult years."
Lens,"The transparent, flexible structure inside the eye that helps focus light onto the retina. The lens changes shape (becoming thicker or thinner) to adjust focus for seeing things at different distances."
Macula,"The central area of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed central vision (the vision you use to read or see faces clearly). When the macula is healthy, it allows you to see fine details straight ahead. (In macular degeneration, this area deteriorates, leading to blurry central vision.)"
Myopia (nearsightedness),"A refractive condition where close objects appear clear but distant objects look blurry. In myopia, the eye focuses images in front of the retina instead of on it, often because the eyeball is slightly too long. This makes far-away scenes appear out of focus."
Optic disc,"The spot on the retina where the optic nerve fibers exit the eye. There are no light-sensing cells in the optic disc, so this spot corresponds to a small “blind spot” in each eye’s vision. (Normally, you don’t notice this blind spot because each eye covers for the other and the brain fills in the gap.)"
Optic nerve,The bundle of nerve fibers that carries visual information from the retina to the brain. It is like a cable connecting the eye to the brain – the images captured by the retina travel along the optic nerve to be interpreted so we can see.
Pars plana,"A flat, rear part of the ciliary body, located just behind the iris. Eye surgeons sometimes enter through the pars plana (which has no retina over it) to perform procedures in the back of the eye."
Posterior chamber,A small space inside the eye located behind the iris and in front of the vitreous gel (it is actually the space just behind the iris and around the lens). The posterior chamber is filled with aqueous humor and is continuous with the anterior chamber through the pupil.
Presbyopia,"An age-related condition in which the lens becomes less flexible, making it harder to focus on close objects. People with presbyopia often need reading glasses to see things up up close, even if they have good distance vision."
Pupil,"The round, dark opening in the center of the iris. The pupil is basically a hole that expands or shrinks (as the iris moves) to regulate the amount of light entering the eye. In bright light the pupil gets smaller, and in dim light it opens wider."
Retina,"The light-sensitive inner layer at the back of the eye that acts like the “film” or sensor in a camera. The retina is made of nerve tissue that senses incoming light and converts it into electrical signals. These signals are sent through the optic nerve to the brain, which interprets them as the images you see."
Retinal detachment,"A serious condition in which the retina is pulled away from the back wall of the eye. When the retina detaches, it loses its blood and nutrient supply, causing sudden vision loss in the affected area. A retinal detachment is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent permanent vision loss."
Retinopathy,"A general term meaning damage to the retina, usually caused by disease or poor blood supply. For example, diabetic retinopathy is retina damage caused by diabetes (high blood sugar injures the retinal blood vessels). Hypertensive retinopathy is retina damage caused by high blood pressure."
Rods,"The light-sensing cells in the retina that are very sensitive in low light. Rods allow you to see in dim or dark conditions (night vision), but they do not perceive color. They work together with the cone cells to provide a full range of vision."
Sclera,"The tough, outer white part of the eyeball. The sclera is the protective coat of the eye and helps maintain the eye’s shape. (The front part of the sclera is continuous with the cornea, and the sclera everywhere else is covered by the conjunctiva.)"
Schlemm’s canal (Canal of Schlemm),"A circular drainage channel in the eye, located at the angle where the iris meets the cornea. Schlemm’s canal collects the aqueous humor from the anterior chamber and delivers it into the bloodstream (veins), allowing the fluid to drain out of the eye. This drainage is crucial for maintaining normal intraocular pressure."
Stroma,"The thick, supportive middle layer of a tissue or organ. In the eye, the corneal stroma is the middle layer of the cornea that makes up about 90% of its thickness and provides structural strength and clarity. (It lies between the cornea’s epithelium and endothelium.)"
Suspensory ligaments (Zonules),"The fine fibers that hold the eye’s lens in place, connecting the lens to the ciliary body (muscle). The suspensory ligaments (also called zonular fibers or zonules) keep the lens centered and taut; when the ciliary muscle focuses, it relaxes tension on these fibers to allow the lens to change shape."
Trabecular meshwork,"A spongy mesh of tiny channels in the drainage angle of the eye (located behind the iris at the edge of the cornea). The trabecular meshwork filters the aqueous humor and helps it drain out of the eye via Schlemm’s canal, maintaining healthy eye pressure."
Uvea,"The collective term for the pigmented, blood vessel-rich middle layer of the eye. The uvea includes the iris, the ciliary body, and the choroid – structures that supply blood to the eye and give it color."
Uveitis,"Inflammation of the uvea, meaning any of the structures in the eye’s middle layer (such as the iris, ciliary body, or choroid) is inflamed. Uveitis can cause eye pain, redness, light sensitivity, and blurred vision, and often requires prompt treatment to prevent complications."
Vitreous humor,"The clear, gel-like substance that fills the large space in the back of the eye behind the lens. The vitreous humor (also just called “the vitreous”) helps the eyeball maintain its shape and allows light to pass through to the retina."
